    <h1>Welcome to FM_Booker</h1>
    <h3>an unexciting database for booking service jobs.</h3>
    <h3>You are logged in as <%= "#{ @current_user.name }" %> (<%= "#{ session[:user_type].capitalize}"%>) of <%= "#{ @current_user.company.name }" %></h3>

    <p>All available actions are in the nav bar.</p>

    <p>This is John's Booking database for Facilities Manitenance. You are not logged in, so this brief explanation is displayed for you.</p>
    <p>The central piece of the database is the "Job" A Job is booked by a booker and attended by a technician. It has a requested date and an address, and has some similarities with Uber I suppose.</p>
    <p>There are two seperate twbles for users - BOOKERS and TECHNICIANS, which are linked to each other only via the JOBS table.</p>
    <ul>BOOKERS
      <li>bob@ga.co / chicken</li>
      <li>helen@ga.co / chicken</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>TECHNICIANS
      <li>finn@ga.co / chicken</li>
      <li>jake@ga.co / chicken</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some points worth noting about Users - </p>
    <ul>
      <li>This is more of a corporate tool than a mass user database. You can't sign yourself up as a new user, either a booker or a technician - a new user must be added by an admin member.</li>
      <li>Whilst the above does make @users a bit simpler, the trade off is that there is two tables of users - bookers and technicians to cater for.</li>
    </ul>
